# TransBridge: Python to Java Translator using Intermediate Code

TransBridge is a source-to-source translator that converts Python code to Java using a custom intermediate representation. It simulates compiler phases like lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation.

## Features
- Parses Python into Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)
- Converts AST to Intermediate Representation (IR)
- Translates IR to syntactically correct Java code
- Handles OOP constructs, loops, conditionals, and type inference

## Technologies Used
- Python, Java
- Lex/Yacc (PLY), AST, IR, Code Generators
